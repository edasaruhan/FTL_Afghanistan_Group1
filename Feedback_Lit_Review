Great job on this assignment! It’s very well-organized and clearly focuses on using advanced technologies to tackle air pollution. 
The literature review is detailed and shows a good understanding of machine learning and deep learning for air quality prediction. 
I like how you combined local and global datasets—it’s a smart way to balance the project’s perspective. 
To make it even better, you could add more recent examples or discuss how to handle challenges like data variability. 
Overall, this is a solid and thoughtful project—well done!
